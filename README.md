# 🌟 Detection Lab (2025)  

The **Detection Lab** is a **hands-on cybersecurity lab** designed to simulate and detect attacks in a controlled environment. The primary goal is to **ingest and analyze logs within a SIEM**, generate test telemetry, and identify attack patterns, providing practical experience with **network security, threat detection, and defensive strategies**.  

---

## 🏁 Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for **simulating cyber attacks and monitoring network activity**. Participants gained experience in:

- Log ingestion and analysis within a **SIEM system**.  
- Generating realistic telemetry to simulate **attack scenarios**.  
- Developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills for **incident detection and response**.  

---

## 🛠 Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of **SIEM concepts** and practical application.  
- Proficiency in **analyzing and interpreting network logs**.  
- Ability to **generate and recognize attack signatures**.  
- Enhanced knowledge of **network protocols and vulnerabilities**.  
- Development of **critical thinking and problem-solving skills** in cybersecurity.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **SIEM System** – for log ingestion, correlation, and analysis.  
- **Network Analysis Tools (e.g., Wireshark)** – capturing and examining network traffic.  
- **Telemetry Generation Tools** – to simulate realistic network traffic and attacks.
